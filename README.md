# robopif
PRAW powered script for scoring a PIF on reddit.

This project is narrowly focused. The single file of Python 3 code uses the PRAW client to read comments in a reddit thread, 
and subsequently selects the winner of the PIF ongoing in the thread. This may not make much sense unless you hang out 
on /r/wetshaving. Maybe not even then.
